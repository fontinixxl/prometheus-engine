# Prometheus Engine Editor - Implementation Documentation

This document outlines the implementation details and fixes made to the Prometheus Engine Editor.

## 1. Overview of Changes

The editor has been significantly improved with the following key changes:

1. Fixed Electron app's path resolution for loading index.html in production mode
2. Created enhanced mock game implementations with proper entity tracking
3. Fixed panel functionality across the application:
   - HierarchyPanel now properly displays scene and entity structures
   - SceneViewPanel visualizes game entities with different shapes and colors
   - PropertiesPanel correctly shows and allows editing entity properties
4. Improved component implementations for better type safety and functionality

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Entity System

We've implemented a comprehensive entity-component system with:

- Entity interfaces for tracking components and properties
- Scene information interfaces for structuring game data
- Visualization of entities with various shapes and colors based on their type

### 2.2 Panel Structure

The editor now features three main panels:

- **HierarchyPanel**: Displays the scene tree with entities and components
- **SceneViewPanel**: Renders a visual representation of game entities
- **PropertiesPanel**: Shows and allows editing of properties for selected items

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Enhanced Mock Game System

Created an enhanced mock implementation in `games.enhanced.ts` with:

- Proper entity interfaces for tracking components and properties
- Scene information interfaces for structured game data
- Random generation of entities with varying shapes and colors

### 3.2 Panel Implementations

#### HierarchyPanel

- Loads and displays game scene data in a tree structure
- Handles entity selection and tree node toggling
- Provides visual feedback for selected items

#### SceneViewPanel

- Renders game entities with different shapes based on component types
- Uses colors to differentiate between entity types
- Implements basic camera controls for viewing the scene

#### PropertiesPanel

- Displays properties for selected entities, components, and scenes
- Supports property editing with type checking
- Shows appropriate loading and error states

### 3.3 Property Editing

- Implemented `PropertyField` component to handle different value types
- Added support for nested properties and complex data structures
- Fixed onChange handlers to properly update properties in the application state

## 4. Using VS Code Tasks

I've added and updated VS Code tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` to streamline development:

- **Run Editor Dev**: Starts the application in development mode
- **Build Editor**: Creates a production build
- **Start Editor**: Runs the production build
- **Run Editor Debug**: Launches the app with DevTools enabled for debugging

To use these tasks:

1. Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "Run Task" and select it
3. Choose one of the available editor tasks

### Running in Debug Mode

The new debug task launches Electron with Chrome DevTools enabled, which is particularly useful for:

- Inspecting React component state
- Debugging the Electron main and renderer processes
- Analyzing performance issues

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Vite Server Port Issues**: If port 5173 is in use, update the port in `vite.config.ts` and in the `dev` script in `package.json`.

2. **React/TypeScript Version Mismatch**: Ensure your React and TypeScript versions are compatible.

3. **Electron Main Process Issues**: If the main process isn't working correctly, try running just the renderer:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:renderer
   ```

4. **Clean and Rebuild**: For persistent issues, try a full clean and rebuild:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules dist
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build
   ```

## 6. Next Steps

The following tasks are still pending:

1. Complete the implementation for loading real games (currently using mock data)
2. Implement save/load functionality for game configurations
3. Add more interactive features to the SceneViewPanel (drag & drop, transformations)
4. Create a comprehensive test suite for the editor components
5. Improve documentation with API details and extension points
